# Gamble Battle Endless Economy Model

## tl;dr

This notebook models the economy from the live July 16, 2026 checkout. It tests
probability-based payouts, fixed chapter-derived prices, several betting
policies, and alternative unit-price ladders. Conclusions are populated by the
executed cells below; the blueprint report is the decision-facing artifact.

## Context & Methods

The design target is a multi-session run where a strong normal player usually
enters fights at 60–75% projected win odds, wagers a minority of bankroll, and
uses all-ins only for exceptional reads.

### Key Assumptions

- Prices come from a fixed reference curve, never the player’s live bankroll.
- The saved odds calibration is directionally useful but too small to authorize
  production payouts by itself.
- The model abstracts qualitative contracts as the power increment required to
  keep pace with the independent chapter curve.
- Current unit-cost balance is compared with the live 1.5× stat multiplier.
- Real player telemetry does not yet exist, so recommendations remain a design
  baseline for playtesting rather than a final shipped balance.

## Takeaways

The final report should treat the following as the model’s decision tests:

1. A fixed unit-price ladder cannot solve exponential bankroll growth by itself.
2. Unit sticker prices should remain tied to unit power and rarity; chapter
   contracts, donor fees, scouting, rerolls, and command upgrades carry the
   long-run price curve.
3. Probability-based payouts can make all-in play mathematically positive but
   strategically overbet, allowing large-money runs without making all-ins the
   default.
4. The “hold ten times the next price” policy must not outperform the odds-aware
   policy on both survival and total earned.
5. The selected coefficients require broader in-engine odds calibration and
   real playtest telemetry before implementation.
