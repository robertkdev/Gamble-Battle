# Unit Art Unapproved Iteration - 2026-07-02

## Scope

User request: iterate unapproved units first, leave new units for last, and keep Vellum as the primary veto anchor.

No live `assets/units/*.png` replacements were made. Outputs below are review candidates only.

## Original Roster Coverage

The original roster now has a latest current candidate recorded in `docs/art/unit_art_proof_matrix.json`.

New or refreshed review artifacts:

- Berebell: `outputs/art_pipeline/style_validation/berebell_vellum_lore_alignment_2026_07_02/berebell_vellum_lore_alignment_v6_raw_candidate.png`
- Cashmere: `outputs/art_pipeline/style_validation/cashmere_vellum_alignment_2026_07_01/cashmere_vellum_alignment_v3_raw_candidate.png`
- Mortem: `outputs/art_pipeline/style_validation/mortem_vellum_lore_alignment_2026_07_02/mortem_vellum_lore_alignment_v3_raw_candidate.png`
- Nyxa: `outputs/art_pipeline/style_validation/nyxa_vellum_lore_alignment_2026_07_02/nyxa_vellum_lore_alignment_v3_raw_candidate.png`
- Repo: `outputs/art_pipeline/style_validation/repo_vellum_lore_alignment_2026_07_02/repo_vellum_lore_alignment_v3_raw_candidate.png`
- Veyra: reused prior best current `outputs/art_pipeline/style_validation/veyra_vellum_alignment_2026_07_01/veyra_vellum_alignment_v4_raw_candidate.png`
- Totem: logged prior lore pass `outputs/art_pipeline/style_validation/totem_lore_alignment_2026_07_01/totem_lore_alignment_v26_raw_candidate.png`
- Creep: logged prior best current `outputs/art_pipeline/style_validation/creep_builtin_revision_candidate_v5_2026_07_01/creep_builtin_revision_candidate_v5_raw.png`
- Grint: fallback matte post `outputs/art_pipeline/style_validation/grint_vellum_lore_alignment_2026_07_02/grint_vellum_lore_alignment_matte_post_v1_raw_candidate.png`
- Bo, Vykos, Volt, Korath, Brute: fallback matte-post batch under `outputs/art_pipeline/style_validation/matte_postprocess_current_candidates_2026_07_02/`

Roster audit sheet:

## New Units Last

The current new dirty batch was treated as:

`caldera`, `egress`, `ivara`, `juno_vale`, `kett`, `marble`, `noxley`, `prisma`, `quorra`, `sable`.

Source identity sheet:

- `outputs/art_pipeline/style_validation/new_units_source_audit_2026_07_02/new_units_source_identity_sheet.png`

Fallback matte-post sheet:

- `outputs/art_pipeline/style_validation/new_units_matte_post_2026_07_02/new_units_matte_post_audit_sheet.png`

Fallback raws:

- `outputs/art_pipeline/style_validation/new_units_matte_post_2026_07_02/*_matte_post_v1_raw_candidate.png`

These are not approved and should not be used as live replacements without review.

## Image Generation Issue

Native image generation worked for Berebell, Cashmere, Mortem, Nyxa, and Repo earlier in the pass.

Later, it returned unrelated educational/infographic images for Creep and Grint prompts. Those outputs were discarded and not copied into the project. After that failure, only deterministic foreground-only matte-post fallback candidates were produced.

## Telegram Artifacts

- Berebell sheet/raw: 455, 456
- Cashmere sheet/raw: 457, 458
- Mortem raw/sheet: 459, 460
- Nyxa sheet/raw: 461, 462
- Repo sheet/raw: 463, 464
- Creep v5 sheet/raw: 466, 467
- Grint fallback sheet/raw: 468, 470
- High-risk old roster matte-post batch sheet: 472
- Refreshed original-roster sheet: 473
- New unit source sheet: 474
- New unit matte-post sheet: 475

## Current Decision State

Vellum remains the primary style anchor. Paisley remains secondary contrast only. The accepted/reference pool was not expanded.

Best-current candidates are still review candidates unless the user explicitly approves them. The fallback matte-post outputs are process aids, not creative proof that those units are solved.
