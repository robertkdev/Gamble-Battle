# Performance Audit - 2026-07-03

Scope: Godot 4.5 Gamble Battle runtime, focused on combat simulation and player-facing combat/UI paths.

## Evidence Collected

- `tests/perf/Perf1v1.tscn` baseline before changes: `time_ms=496`, `frames=901`, signature `-6199507685307107293:55`, errors `[]`.
- `tests/perf/Perf1v1.tscn` after allocation fixes: `time_ms=472`, `434`, `447`, `frames=901`, same signature `-6199507685307107293:55`, errors `[]`.
- Partial `tests/perf/Perf1v1Sweep.tscn` showed `delta_s=0.05` variants preserved the baseline signature, while `delta_s=0.25` changed aggregate signatures. Coarser simulation steps are not safe as a default yet.
- `tests/rga_testing/validation/RoleMatrixProbe6v6.tscn` after changes: `PASS`, `failed=0`, `skipped=0`, `errors=0`, `wall_ms=10079`.

## Changes Made

- `scripts/game/combat/systems/target_controller.gd`
  - Changed target-array synchronization from per-call rebuilds to in-place resizing.
  - This removes repeated hot-loop allocation from `current_target()`, which movement calls for every unit.
- `scripts/game/combat/systems/cooldown_scheduler.gd`
  - Changed cooldown-array synchronization from per-frame rebuilds to in-place resizing.
  - Avoids per-frame `Array[float]` allocation during `advance()`.
  - Avoids `slice()` allocation in `_order_for()` when order arrays already match team size.

## Current Hotspots

1. Combat movement is the primary optimization surface.
   - `MovementService2._update_impl()` computes alive flags, target groups, slot maps, steering, avoidance, and collision resolution every simulation step.
   - `SlotStrategy` uses permutation assignment for grouped attackers. Current 6v6 sizes are small, but this is factorial within each target group and should be bounded before larger boards.

2. Targeting does meaningful per-candidate scoring.
   - `Targeting.pick_by_priority()` walks live enemies and may score ally peel pressure and nearby units.
   - The `target_recheck_interval_s=0.35` throttle is important. Do not move this to per-frame retargeting.

3. Telemetry and UI signals are broad.
   - Combat emits position, target, hit, stat, and team-stat signals.
   - UI listeners such as HUD/stat refreshes update many unit views. Keep stat snapshots/event payloads throttled and avoid emitting unchanged data.

4. Simulation cadence is sensitive.
   - `delta_s=0.25` is much faster but changed signatures in the sweep.
   - Treat coarse stepping or adaptive stepping as experimental until it has matchup-level acceptance thresholds, not just timing wins.

## Recommended Next Optimizations

1. Add a dedicated `Perf6v6` benchmark scene that runs representative neutral/burst/peel boards repeatedly and reports median/p95 wall time plus deterministic signatures.
2. Add a movement fast path for exactly one attacker per target that bypasses ring-slot permutation and unnecessary group assignment, then validate against 1v1 and 6v6 signatures.
3. Bound `SlotStrategy._best_assignment()` with a deterministic non-factorial fallback for groups above a small limit.
4. Add per-signal counters in a diagnostics-only perf scene for `position_updated`, `target_start/end`, `team_stats_updated`, and UI refresh calls.
5. Review combat UI refreshes so `update_from_unit()` and bar updates only run when visible values changed.

## Guardrails

- Do not make `delta_s=0.25` or larger a default optimization without balance/RGA acceptance work.
- Preserve deterministic signatures for headless perf scenes when changing allocation, targeting, movement, or telemetry paths.
- Validate multi-unit behavior after combat hot-loop edits with `RoleMatrixProbe6v6.tscn` or a broader RGA smoke.
